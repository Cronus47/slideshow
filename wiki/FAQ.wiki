=== How can I specify a directory for the thumbnail rather then appending a 't' to the image name? ===

_For example, the full-size image is "1.jpg" and the thumbnail "thumbs/1.jpg"._

You would need to modify the [http://code.google.com/p/slideshow/wiki/Slideshow#Options: replace] option, something like:

{{{
'replace': [/^(.*)$/, 'thumbs/$1']
}}}

See [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference:Global_Objects:RegExp Regular Expressions] reference for more information.

=== OK, but what if the images and thumbs are in two separate folders? ===

_For example, the full-size image is "slides/1.jpg" and the thumbnail "thumbs/1.jpg"._

You will have to use the parent folder "/" for [http://code.google.com/p/slideshow/wiki/Slideshow#Options: hu], then prepend "slides/" to the image filenames: 

{{{
data = [ 'slides/1.jpg', 'slides/2.jpg', ... ];
}}}

Then your replace would be something like:

{{{ 
replace = [/^slides(.*)$/, 'thumbs$1'];
}}}

=== Is it possible to have multiple slideshows per page? ===

Sure. You will just need to give each wrapper element it's own ID, and initialize a new instance of the class for each one:

{{{ 
<div id="keylin" class="slideshow"><img src="keylin/1.jpg" alt="Keylin" /></div>
<div id="gustavo" class="slideshow"><img src="gustavo/1.jpg" alt="Gustavo" /></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
  window.addEvent('domready', function(){
    new Slideshow('keylin', ['1.jpg', '2.jpg', '3.jpg'], {height: 300, hu: 'keylin/', width: 400});
    new Slideshow('gustavo', ['1.jpg', '2.jpg', '3.jpg'], {height: 300, hu: 'gustavo/', width: 400});
  });
</script>
}}}

=== Why does Slideshow disappear in Internet Explorer? ===

_While my slideshow works flawlessly in Safari and Firefox, both IE6 and IE7 do not display it properly. Instead, I merely see a brief "blip" of the default image, which then disappears, never to return._

The problem often is a trailing comma in the list of pictures, for example:

{{{
var data = {
  "img1.jpg":{caption:"Image 1"},
  "img2.jpg":{caption:"Image 2"},
};
}}}

In order to make it work in IE, just delete the last comma and write it like this:

{{{
var data = {
  "img1.jpg":{caption:"Image 1"},
  "img2.jpg":{caption:"Image 2"}
};
}}}

See the closing `}` after Image 2? No comma!

=== How can I resize the Slideshow? ===

_I am having trouble resizing the div - I don't see it anywhere in the Slideshow CSS._

Since height and width are attributes of the presentation, it is best to change these values in the stylesheet:

{{{
.slideshow-images {
  height: 300px;
  width: 400px;
}
}}}

Slideshow will parse in these values on initialization and adjust the dimensions of the show accordingly. You can also do the same thing in reverse by setting the options in the Slideshow class:

{{{
new Slideshow('show', data, { height: 300, hu: 'images/', width: 400 });
}}}

The only difference is the show will only take those dimensions if Javascript is enabled. Note: these attributes only affect the size of the "slides" or Slideshow images (more information [http://code.google.com/p/slideshow/wiki/HTML in the Wiki]):

{{{
<div class="slideshow">
  <div class="slideshow-images">
    <a><img /></a>
  </div>
 ...
</div>
}}}

In order to affect the dimensions of the Slideshow wrapper (that contains the controller, captions, thumbnails, etc) you will need to set the following class in the stylesheet:

{{{
.slideshow {
  height: 300px;
  width: 400px;
}
}}}

Accordingly, the size of the Slideshow images will not be affected.

=== Why won't Slideshow work with Google Maps? ===

_I load a page with Google Maps, Mootools 1.2 and Slideshow and initiate a Slideshow and a Map on their own DIVs and Firebug reports:_

{{{
"A parameter or an operation is not supported by the underlying object" code: 15 /scripts/mootools_core.js Line 3162
}}}

This is a Google Maps issue. Simply loading the Maps CSS after the Javascript gives this error. Placing the CSS file before the Javascript was included fixed it.

=== When I use PNG images with an alpha channel the previous image can be seen behind the current one? ===

_I only want to see the current image - the previous image should be gone._

Initialize Slideshow with the [http://code.google.com/p/slideshow/wiki/Slideshow#Options: overlap: false] option.
