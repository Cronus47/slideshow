=== How can I specify a directory for the thumbnail rather then appending a 't' to the image name? ===

_For example, the full-size image is "1.jpg" and the thumbnail "thumbs/1.jpg"._

You would need to modify the [http://code.google.com/p/slideshow/wiki/Slideshow#Options: replace] option, something like:

{{{
'replace': [/^(.*)$/, 'thumbs/$1']`. 
}}}

See [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference:Global_Objects:RegExp Regular Expressions] reference for more information.

=== OK, but what if the images and thumbs are in two separate folders? ===

_For example, the full-size image is "slides/1.jpg" and the thumbnail "thumbs/1.jpg"._

You will have to use the parent folder "/" for [http://code.google.com/p/slideshow/wiki/Slideshow#Options: hu], then prepend "slides/" to the image filenames: 

{{{
data = [ 'slides/1.jpg', 'slides/2.jpg', ... ];
}}}

Then your replace would be something like:

{{{ 
replace = [/^slides(.*)$/, 'thumbs$1'];
}}}
