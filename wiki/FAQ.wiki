=== I would like to specify a directory that contains thumbnail rather then appending a 't' to the image name ===

_For instance "images/1.jpg and images/thumbs/1.jpg" Is this a possibility?_

Sure - you would just need to modify the "replace" option, something like 'replace': [/^(.*)$/, 'thumbs/$1']
